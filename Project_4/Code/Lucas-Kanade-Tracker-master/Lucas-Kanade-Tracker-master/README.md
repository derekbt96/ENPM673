# Lucas-Kanade-Tracker
I have made tracking system to track any feature in videos. I have done it using two methods: 1.Lucas Kanade Tracker using six parameter affine model and recursive Gauss-Newton process and 2.using OpenCV library. First one is implemented using research paper Lucas-Kanade 20 Years On: by simon Baker (Microsoft Computer vision researcher). I have implemented the algorithms given in this paper and used standard libraries for mathematical operation. Then i compared both implementation. Detailed algorithm and comparsion is shown in attached pdf.
You simply need to run the code and you can also use your system camera for tracking purposes or you can use the sample video attached with it. Application of lucas kanade algorithm like video stabilization and image mosiacing with code is attached in another repository name Video stabilization and image mosiacing.You can check it.
